        <p> It pleasant surprise nestled in the CDMX, this weekend my family and I decided to visit this park and that pleasant surprise this was where the refinery, is a place very clean and well maintained, is totally free and one can exercise , live, play, and even relax under the shade of a tree. Likewise there is an area to make a meal or children's Party, the super clean bathrooms a worthy orchids visit and lakes and small ponds with fish, herons, turtles and ducks. It is worthwhile to have some fun there, and from time to time, I do not live near the area, go to exercise.
